A simple chrome extension to speed up playback speed in Udemy.

# How to install?

I could have published it on the Chrome Webstore, but they are asking money. :P

Steps:
-Download the code of this repository as .zip. Extract it.
-Navigate to chrome://extensions
-Expand the Developer dropdown menu and click “Load Unpacked Extension”
-Navigate to the local folder containing the extension’s code and click Ok
-Assuming there are no errors, the extension should load into your browser

_If you any other Chromium based browser, the process will be pretty much the same. Just replace "chrome://" with "brave://" or "edge://" and so on._
